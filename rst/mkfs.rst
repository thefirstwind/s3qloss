====================
File System Creation
====================

A S3QL file system is created with the `mkfs.s3ql` command. It has the
following syntax::

  mkfs.s3ql [options] <storage url>

.. NOTE::

  When using the Amazon S3 backend and working with a newly created
  bucket initial performance is often very bad (cf. `issue 363
  <http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/issues/detail?id=363>`_). This
  problem typically disappears after 1 -- 2 days.
  
This command accepts the following options:

.. pipeinclude:: ../bin/mkfs.s3ql --help
   :start-after: show this help message and exit

Unless you have specified the `--plain` option, `mkfs.s3ql` will ask
you to enter an encryption password. This password will *not* be read
from an authentication file specified with the :cmdopt:`--authfile`
option to prevent accidental creation of an encrypted file system.
